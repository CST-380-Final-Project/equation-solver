## ðŸ’¡ App Idea 1: LocalLens

**What:**  
LocalLens is a discovery app that helps users find nearby businesses, cafes, restaurants, and service providers using an interactive map, filters (distance, price, rating), and community reviews.

**Who:**  
Urban explorers, tourists, and locals looking to try new places or find reliable nearby services (e.g., food, salons, repair shops).

**Why:**  
People often rely on community insights before trying new businesses, but many discovery apps are cluttered or lack helpful filters. LocalLens aims to simplify discovery with clean filtering and reliable, upvoted reviews.

**Challenges:**  
- Collecting and moderating user-generated reviews.
- Displaying businesses on a responsive map with real-time filtering.
- Potential need for third-party API integration (like Google Places).
